		<h3>For some, creative expression can be a life-affirming activity.</h3>
		<p>
			You may have experienced this for yourself, or you may be seeking to find it.
			I am a lifelong indie game designer-developer, and I would like to help you find it
			-- either again, or perhaps for the first time, but I suspect that when you find it,
			the form it takes will be more familiar than not.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many things that get in the way of creative expression in this life.
			I have experienced many of them, but certainly not all of them.
			Reach out if you'd like to talk about what you want out of your creative practice and process,
			and how to get there,
			past all of those things that are getting in the way.
