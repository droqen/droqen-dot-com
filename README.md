my front page website. im trackin it through the ages here now.

## what even is a front page for?
it's sort of like... the way you dress. but not really? no, it's more like the way you introduce yourself to someone you've just met. it isn't the very first impression that they get of you, but once you get through the dance of "hi, i'm a human!" "wow, me too, what are the odds!" and enter the slightly deeper than surface level topics, it's what you say in response to "so, what do you do?"

well, what in the hell _do_ i do?

exaggeration and outright lying are things that people do. that's life. more to the point, people also curate themselves. "the map is not the territory" as they say, and as i saw someone say on one of the social medias once, "the map tells us what parts of the territory we are allowed to ignore."

listen, i hate being ignored, ok. i want to be every complex, multifaceted droqen i can be.

but sometimes, sometimes, people have a finite and mortal capacity to receive information about your identity, and you have to pick your battles.

## who am i?
